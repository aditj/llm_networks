    "narrative_2":"Through some but not all of these gorges run never-failing streams of\nclear water. In a few instances the gorge expands and takes the\nproportions of a narrow vale. Then the high timber that usually skirts\nthe rivulets shrinks to detached groves, and patches of clear land\nappear, which, if cultivated, would afford scanty support to one or two\nmodern families. To the village Indian such tillable spots were of the\ngreatest value. The deep ravine afforded shelter not only against the\nclimate but against roving enemies, and the land was sufficient for his\nmodest crops; since his wants were limited, and game was abundant.",
    "narrative_3":"The material of which the walls of these caons are composed, suggested\nin times past to the house-building Indian the idea of using them as a\nhome. The tufa and pumice-stone are so friable that, as we have said,\nthe rock can be dug or burrowed with the most primitive implements. It\nwas easier, in fact, to excavate dwellings than to pile up walls in the\nopen air.",
    "narrative_4":"Therefore the northern sides of these secluded gorges are perforated in\nmany places by openings similar in appearance to pigeon-holes. These\nopenings are the points of exit and entrance of artificial caves, dug\nout by sedentary aborigines in times long past. They are met with in\nclusters of as many as several hundred; more frequently, however, the\ngroups are small. Sometimes two or more tiers of caves are superimposed.",

    "narrative_0":"CHAPTER I. \"EMILY DID IT.\" Among my earliest recollections these three words have a place, coming\nto my ears as the presages of a reprimand. I had made a frantic effort\nto lift my baby-brother from his cradle, and had succeeded only in\nupsetting baby, pillows and all, waking my mother from her little nap,\nwhile brother Hal stood by and shouted, \"Emily did it.\" I was only five\nyears of age at that eventful period, and was as indignant at the\nscolding I received when trying to do a magnanimous act, take care of\nbaby and let poor, tired mother sleep, as I have been many times since,\nwhen, unluckily, I had upset somebody's dish, and \"Emily did it\" has\nrung its hateful sound in my ears. To say I was unlucky was not enough;\nI was untimely, unwarranted and unwanted, I often felt, in early years\nin everything I attempted, and the naturally quick temper I possessed\nwas only aggravated and tortured into more harassing activity, rendering\nme on the whole, perhaps, not very amiable. Interesting I could not be,\nsince whatever I attempted I seemed fated to say or do something to hurt\nsomebody's feelings, and, mortified at my failures, I would draw myself\ncloser to myself, shrinking from others, and saying again and again,\n\"Emily, why _must_ you do it?\"",

    "narrative_3":"Mother was the only real friend I had; it seemed to me, as I grew older,\nshe learned to know that I was too often blamed, where at heart I was\nwholly blameless, and when sometimes she stroked my hair, and said, \"My\ndear child, how unlucky you are,\" I felt that I could do anything for\nher, and she never, to my remembrance, said \"Emily did it.\"",
    "narrative_4":"From my father I often heard it. Hal rarely, if ever, said anything\nelse, and if I did sometimes darn his stockings a little too thick, it\nwas not such a heinous crime. He was handsome, and I was as proud of his\nface as I was ashamed of my own; I know now that my features were not so\nbad, but my spirit never shone through them, while Hal carried every\nthought right in his face.

Neither tree, hill, nor wood intercepted the\nrushing gale, to change the dull monotony of its gloomy tone. The Ythan,\nindeed, darted by, swollen and turbid from continued storms, threatening\nto overflow the barren plain it watered, but its voice was\nundistinguishable amidst the louder wail of wind and ocean. Pine-trees,\ndark, ragged, and stunted, and scattered so widely apart that each one\nseemed monarch of some thirty acres, were the only traces of vegetation\nfor miles round.

The warlike inhabitants of the tower, though\ncomparatively few in number, were continually passing to and fro in the\ncourts and galleries, or congregating in little knots, in eager\nconverse. Some cleansing their armor or arranging banners; others, young\nand active, practising the various manoeuvres of mimic war; each and\nall bearing on their brow that indescribable expression of anticipation\nand excitement which seems ever on the expectant of it knows not what.\nThe condition of Scotland was indeed such as to keep her sons constantly\non the alert, preparing for defence or attack, as the insurging efforts\nof the English or the commands of their lords should determine.",

    "hallucination_questions":"Despite daily cleanings, what has lain in the waiting-room corners 'for lo, these many years' at Mount Mark station?",
    "narrative_0":"CHAPTER I INTRODUCING HER None but the residents consider Mount Mark, Iowa, much of a town, and\nthose who are honest among them admit, although reluctantly, that Mount\nMark can boast of far more patriotism than good judgment!  But the\n_very most_ patriotic of them all has no word of praise for the ugly\nlittle red C., B. & Q. railway station.  If pretty is as pretty does,\nas we have been told so unpleasantly often, then the station is\nhandsome enough, but as an ornament to the commonwealth it is a dismal\nfailure,--low, smoky and dust-grimed.  In winter its bleakness and\nbareness add to the chill of the rigorous Iowa temperature, and in\nsummer the sap oozing through the boards is disagreeably suggestive of\nperspiration.  The waiting-room itself is \"cleaned\" every day, and yet\nthe same dust lies in the corners where it has lain for lo, these many\nyears.  And as for the cobwebs, their chief distinction lies in their\nripe old age.  If there were only seven spiders in the ark, after the\nsubsiding of the waters, at least a majority of them must have found\ntheir way to Mount Mark station in South-eastern Iowa.",
    "narrative_1":"Mount Mark is anything but proud of the little station.  It openly\nscoffs at it, and sniffs contemptuously at the ticket agent who bears\nthe entire C., B. & Q. reputation upon his humble shoulders.  At the\nsame time, it certainly does owe the railroad and the state a debt of\ngratitude for its presence there.  It is the favorite social rendezvous\nfor the community!  Only four passenger trains daily pass through Mount\nMark,--not including the expresses, which rush haughtily by with no\nmore than a scornful whistle for the sleepy town, and in return for\nthis indignity, Mount Mark cherishes a most unchristian antipathy\ntoward those demon fliers.",
    "narrative_2":"But the \"passengers\"--ah, that is a different matter.  The arrival of a\npassenger train in Mount Mark is an event--something in the nature of a\nC., B. & Q. \"At Home,\" and is always attended by a large and\nenthusiastic gathering of \"our best people.\"  All that is lacking are\nthe proverbial \"light refreshments!\"",
    "narrative_3":"So it happened that one sultry morning, late in the month of August,\nthere was the usual flutter of excitement and confusion on the platform\nand in the waiting-room of the station.  The habitus were there in\nforce.  Conspicuous among them were four gaily dressed young men,\nsmoking cigarettes and gazing with lack-luster eyes upon the animated\nscene, which evidently bored them.  All the same, they invariably\nappeared at the depot to witness this event, stirring to others no\ndoubt, but incapable of arousing the interest of these life-weary\nyouths.

London, swart and grim, semi-shrouded in a warm close mist of mingled human breath and acrid vapour steaming up from the clammy crowded streets,--London, with a million twinkling lights gleaming sharp upon its native blackness, and looking, to a dreamer's eye, like some gigantic Fortress, built line upon line and tower upon tower,--with huge ramparts raised about it frowningly as though in self-defence against Heaven. Around and above it the deep sky swept in a ring of sable blue, wherein thousands of stars were visible, encamped after the fashion of a mighty army, with sentinel planets taking their turns of duty in the watching of a rebellious world. A sulphureous wave",
    "narrative_3":"of heat half asphyxiated the swarms of people who were hurrying to and fro in that restless undetermined way which is such a predominating feature of what is called a London \"season,\" and the general impression of the weather was, to one and all, conveyed in a sense of discomfort and oppression, with a vague struggling expectancy of approaching thunder. Few raised their eyes beyond the thick warm haze which hung low on the sooty chimney-pots, and trailed sleepily along in the arid, dusty parks. Those who by chance looked higher, saw that the skies above the city were divinely calm and clear, and that not a cloud betokened so much as the shadow of a storm.",
    "narrative_4":"The deep bell of Westminster chimed midnight, that hour of picturesque\nghostly tradition, when simple village maids shudder at the thought of\ntraversing a dark lane or passing a churchyard, and when country folks\nof old-fashioned habits and principles are respectably in bed and for\nthe most part sleeping. But so far as the fashionable \"West End\" was\nconcerned, it might have been midday. Everybody assuming to be Anybody,\nwas in town. The rumble of carriages passing to and fro was\nincessant,--the swift whirr and warning hoot of coming and going motor\nvehicles, the hoarse cries of the newsboys, and the general insect-like\ndrone and murmur of feverish human activity were as loud as at any busy\ntime of the morning or the afternoon. There had been a Court at\nBuckingham Palace,--and a \"special\" performance at the Opera,--and on\naccount of these two functions, entertainments were going on at almost\nevery fashionable house in every fashionable quarter. The public\nrestaurants were crammed with luxury-loving men and women,--men and\nwomen to whom the mere suggestion of a quiet dinner in their own homes\nwould have acted as a menace of infinite boredom,--and these gilded and\nrefined eating-houses were now beginning to shoot forth their bundles of\nwell-dressed, well-fed folk into the many and various conveyances\nwaiting to receive them. There was a good deal of needless shouting, and\nmuch banter between drivers and policemen.",
