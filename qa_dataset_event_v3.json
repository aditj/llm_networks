    "narrative_0":"The US Senate has cleared President Donald Trump's pick Stephen Miran to join the Federal Reserve's board of governors - part of a panel responsible for setting the country's interest rates. Miran, who is chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, will be thefirst sitting White House official to join the Fed's boardsince its creation in its current form in the 1930s. He was narrowly confirmed on Monday with a vote of 48-47. The economist's entry has raised concerns over the central bank's longstanding independence and follows Trump's bid toreshape the Federal Reserve. Miran is expected to take part in a key Fed policy meeting this week as one of 12 voting members, playing a central role in Trump's bid for a large interest rate cut. The Fed is expected to approve a quarter-percentage point rate cut to support a weakening labour market. Miran is a supporter ofTrump's global tariffs, arguing the import duties won't fuel inflation and that policies like stricter immigration will reduce housing demand and lower prices.",

Supporters call it overdue accountability; critics call it a breach of central-bank independence. Miran will vote at this week\u2019s policy meeting, where a quarter-point cut is telegraphed even as the administration lobbies for something bigger.

Israel's decision to target Hamas leaders in Qatar - a close US ally - drew international outrage and criticism from US President Donald Trump.

The case has been closely followed in Zambia, as this was the first time anyone was put on trial for attempting to use witchcraft against a president. The prosecution alleged that Phiri and Candunde were hired by a fugitive former MP to bewitch Hichilema. Despite their insistence that they were bona fide traditional healers, the court found them guilty on two counts under the Witchcraft Act. \"The two accepted ownership of the charms.

    "narrative_0":"UK-Belarus dual citizen Julia Fenner, who is the wife of a British diplomat, has been freed from prison by Belarus as part of a broader release agreed with the US. She had been given a long jail term last month after being detained on the border as she entered Belarus in March 2024. UK Europe Minister Stephen Doughty said \"it is great news that a British national has been brought home\". Fifty-two prisoners were freed from Belarus on Thursday as part of an agreement between US President Donald Trump and authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who is a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. In exchange for the release of political prisoners, the US said it would relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing the carrier to buy parts for its planes. Stephen Doughty called the release \"a significant breakthrough\" and thanked the US for \"substantial diplomatic efforts to secure this outcome\".",

Among 52 freed was dual national Julia Fenner\u2014the diplomat\u2019s wife seized at the border in March and slammed with a long sentence last month.

Inside the wreckage, officers discovered \u00a32,000 in cash, 34 cheap mobile phones, and a woman\u2019s passport. A placenta wrapped in a towel was found on the back seat. It revealed to police the existence of a newborn baby. The owner of the passport and her partner, it emerged, were well known to social services. A nationwide search was launched to find them, which quickly became front-page news. But for the next two months, through a bitterly cold winter, the couple went to exceptional lengths to avoid being caught. Despite having access to plenty of money, they lived rough in a cheap tent and scavenged in bins. When they were eventually arrested at the end of February, their baby was no longer with them - and they refused to tell police where she was.",

And yet they had utter contempt for the court process. They caused chaos across their two trials, which both overran by months. At one point, the Old Bailey's most senior judge accused them of trying to \"sabotage\" and \"manipulate\" their retrial. It nearly collapsed a number of times. Their behaviour - from refusing to turn up to court and claiming to be ill, to sacking countless barristers and Gordon's trousers even being misplaced one day - left His Honour Judge Mark Lucraft KC exasperated on many occasions.
